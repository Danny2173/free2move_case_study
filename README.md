EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - Free2move Case Study

This repository contains my exploratory data analysis on a city car sharing system. The purpose of which is to answer the two questions:

1. What recommmendations would you make to management about the company's operations?
  
2. While a vehicle is charging, there’s a chance someone might rent it before the battery is fully charged. At what battery level
is this chance too low?
